Dataset Description
This project uses a password dataset for a cybersecurity-related machine learning task.
The dataset contains passwords along with extracted features that describe their structure,
such as length, character composition, and complexity indicators.
The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can automatically
identify whether a password is strong or weak based on its characteristics.
This type of problem is important in cybersecurity for improving authentication systems
and detecting insecure passwords.
 Machine Learning Problem
- Type: Supervised Learning
- Task: Classification
- Input: Password features (length, digits, symbols, etc.)
- Output:Password strength class (e.g., Weak / Strong)
